Each part of London offers its own unique charm. Covent Garden is perfect for street performances and great food, while Soho is vibrant and full of bars and theaters. Camden Market is ideal for quirky shopping and street food, and Notting Hill is famous for its colorful houses and the bustling Portobello Road Market. For a bit of history, head to Greenwich, home to the Royal Observatory and the Prime Meridian line.
