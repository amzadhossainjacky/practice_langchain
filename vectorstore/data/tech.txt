What Does the iPhone 16 Pro’s IP68 Rating Actually Mean?
Apple’s IP68 rating is often the first thing people notice. Sounds impressive, right? But unless you’re familiar with tech specs, those numbers might not mean much. Here’s the translation: the IP rating is an industry standard, where “6” stands for dust protection and “8” for water resistance. In short, the iPhone 16 Pro is supposed to withstand submersion in water up to 6 meters deep for a maximum of 30 minutes.

In theory, this means your iPhone can handle being dropped in the sink, caught in a downpour, or taking an accidental dip in a pool. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves — there’s more to the story.

Everyday Protection vs. Underwater Adventures
Here’s where things get tricky. Sure, the iPhone 16 Pro can survive water exposure in everyday scenarios. Spill your coffee on it? You’re probably fine. Drop it in a puddle? No big deal. But don’t plan your next deep-sea dive with this thing. Even though the IP68 rating suggests it can go underwater for a limited time, real-world usage is a whole different game.

The rating applies under controlled conditions — freshwater, a stable environment, and zero motion. In the real world, where phones get banged around, dropped, and exposed to all kinds of unpredictable forces, those seals keeping the water out can start to wear down. That’s right — the water resistance is not guaranteed forever. Over time, it will degrade.
