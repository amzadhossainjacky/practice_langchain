Students of the seven government colleges affiliated with Dhaka University have issued a four-hour ultimatum demanding the implementation of six-point demands. 

"If our demands are not met by 4:00pm, we will announce a tougher course of action," Sajib Uddin, secretary general of Students Against Discrimination at Dhaka College, made the announcement at a press briefing on the Dhaka College campus this morning.

The demands are:
The establishment of an independent university for the seven colleges separate from Dhaka University
Official apology from the Dhaka University authorities for the clashes between Dhaka University and seven college students, as well as the resignation of Pro-Vice Chancellor Mamun Ahmed
Departmental investigation into the "assault" on Dhaka College student Rakib by police last night and action against the assistant commissioner and officer-in-charge of New Market Police Station
Measures against Dhaka University students, who made inappropriate comments and gestures towards female students of Eden College during the clashes
Resolution of the issue through a high-level meeting, with participation from the chief adviser, education adviser, Adviser Nahid Islam, the UGC member, the DU vice chancellor, and student representatives
Reopening of the city corporation roads within the Dhaka University campus 

Alongside complete severance of academic and administrative ties with Dhaka University, along with a formal declaration to establish an independent university for the seven colleges, the other demands include an official apology from the Dhaka University authorities for the clashes between Dhaka University and seven college students, as well as the resignation of Pro-Vice Chancellor Mamun Ahmed.
